# vocabList-kivy
This app will create a list of words and thier meanings.  
User should enter a word and the app will search for its meaning and add that word to the list.  
I'm also working on flashcards, where user will be shown a random card and keep track how user is learning new words.  
It uses Wordnik API for fetching meaning of words.  
GUI is implemented using Kivy
